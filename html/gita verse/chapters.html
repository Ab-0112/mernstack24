            <p>The Bhagavad Gita is a 700-verse Hindu scripture that is part of the Indian epic Mahabharata, specifically in the Bhishma Parva (Book of Bhishma). It is a spiritual dialogue between Prince Arjuna and the god Krishna, who serves as his charioteer. The conversation takes place on the battlefield of Kurukshetra just before the onset of a great war, where Arjuna is confused and morally troubled about fighting in the war. The Gita addresses his concerns and provides profound teachings on life, duty, and spirituality. The text is revered for its philosophical and practical guidance on living a meaningful life.
